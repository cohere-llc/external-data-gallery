Gallery of scripts for working with 3rd party data providers

The gallery is organized into two sections.

## Examples

In `examples/` are complete scripts used for specific research applications that have been contributed to the gallery. They often make use of data from several providers and in a number of formats. They are typically in Python or R and can include complex data processesing steps. Instructions for running the scripts are included in a `README` for each example.

## Notebooks

In `notebooks/` are simplified scripts in Jupyter notebooks intended to demonstrate how to interact with one data provider, protocol, or file format. Click the `binder` badge above to try them out in an interactive Jupyter environment. (Valid credentials may be required for some data providers.)
